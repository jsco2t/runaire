# US-018 — entry expiration metadata round-trips through KeePassXC.
# Verifies FR-017 (expiration metadata).
#
# Note on KeePassXC interop surface: `keepassxc-cli show` does not
# surface `Times.Expires` in its default output, so we cross-check via
# `keepassxc-cli export -f xml`, which is the documented stable
# interchange format and includes the full Times block. We assert the
# entry's <Expires>True</Expires> tag appears in the XML and the root
# group's stays False.
