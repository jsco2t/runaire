//! Distribution sanity test for the random-password generator.
//!
//! Per Phase 2 task plan §T2.4: a deterministic chi-squared test that
//! catches a regression to modulo bias in the index-sampling helper.
//! The deterministic stream is `SplitMix64::new(0xDEAD)` — see
//! `tests/common/mod.rs` for why we use `SplitMix64` rather than
//! `ChaCha20Rng` (keeps the crate free of `rand`/`rand_chacha`).
//!
//! ## Why single-class?
//!
//! The "reserve-and-fill" algorithm intentionally biases the
//! per-output distribution toward smaller classes (a class of size 10
//! contributes a reserve character with probability `1/length`, but
//! each individual digit is `1/10` likely within that draw versus
//! `1/union_size` in the fill step). A chi-squared test against a
//! uniform-over-union expectation would flag this *correct* behavior
//! as a failure.
//!
//! Instead this test exercises a **single-class** builder
//! (lowercase only, 26 chars), where reserve + fill draw from the
//! same alphabet and the per-character expected distribution is
//! genuinely uniform. This isolates the rejection-sampler — the only
//! place a `% n` regression could hide.
//!
//! ## Expected behavior
//!
//! 10,000 length-100 lowercase passwords = 1,000,000 sampled
//! characters across 26 buckets. Expected count per bucket ≈ 38,461.5.
//! For 25 degrees of freedom the chi-squared critical value at
//! p = 0.001 is approximately 52.6. With a true uniform sampler and
//! our fixed seed the observed statistic is single- to low-double
//! digits; a regression to `%` on a single raw byte produces values
//! in the hundreds. The headroom is enormous.

// Counts fit comfortably below 2^52 (10k × 100 = 1M; 26 buckets) so
// the integer → f64 casts are precise. Truncation lints are silenced
// because this is well-understood arithmetic on bounded test data.
