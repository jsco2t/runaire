//! Single public error type for the `runaire-core` crate.
//!
//! Per design §2.2.3 and §2.5: every fallible operation returns
//! [`VaultError`]. Variants carry only structured, non-secret context
//! (paths, names, source errors). No variant ever embeds a master
//! password, a derived key, or decrypted vault contents.
//!
//! ## Source payload provenance
//!
//! `InvalidFormat` and `WriteFailed` carry upstream `keepass-rs` error
//! types as `#[source]`; `InvalidOtpUri` carries an in-tree
//! [`crate::entry::totp::OtpAuthUriError`]. The variant identities are
//! stable; only the wrapped source types may change when a dependency
//! upgrade reshapes its error surface.
