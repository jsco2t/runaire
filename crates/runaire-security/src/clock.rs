//! Abstract source of monotonic time.
//!
//! Production code uses [`SystemClock`], which delegates to
//! `std::time::Instant::now()`. Unit tests use a `FakeClock` (arrives
//! in Phase 2, `tests/common/clock.rs`) that lets the test set the
//! current `Instant` deterministically.
//!
//! ## Design note
//!
//! `crate::auto_lock::AutoLockController` (Phase 2) does NOT itself
//! hold a `Clock`. The frontend passes the current `Instant` to
//! `tick()` and `register_activity()`; the controller stays a pure
//! state machine. The trait exists for any consumer that wants a
//! clock-injection seam at its own level (TUI, agent), and the future
//! `runaire-agent` shares this trait so test infrastructure
//! (`FakeClock`) can be re-used across crates.
