//! OS lock-event sources.
//!
//! Frontends compose `runaire-security` with one or more
//! [`OsLockEventSource`] implementations. Each source runs on its own
//! thread (spawned by [`crate::auto_lock::AutoLockController::attach_event_source`])
//! and pushes [`crate::auto_lock::SecurityEvent`]s into the
//! controller's internal channel; the controller drains that channel
//! during [`crate::auto_lock::AutoLockController::tick`].
//!
//! ## MVP sources (this crate)
//!
//! - [`NoopSource`] — always available; produces no events. Useful as
//!   a default on platforms where no native source has been wired up
//!   yet, and as the "do nothing" baseline in tests.
//! - [`SigstopSource`] — Unix only. Catches `SIGTSTP` (terminal stop),
//!   emits `SecurityEvent::OsLock { reason: Sigstop }`, then re-raises
//!   `SIGSTOP` to actually stop the process. `SIGCONT` is observed but
//!   not forwarded — when the process resumes the vault is already
//!   locked and the user re-authenticates normally. See the
//!   [feature design][design] §3.4 for the PRD-literal "SIGSTOP" →
//!   SIGTSTP-catching discrepancy.
//!
//! [design]: ../../../notebook/projects/runaire/features/security-behaviors/plans/design.md
//!
//! ## Post-MVP sources (Phase 5)
//!
//! - `LogindSource` (Linux, `zbus`) — subscribes to systemd-logind's
//!   `PrepareForSleep` and `Session.Lock` signals.
//! - `IoKitSource` (macOS, `objc2`) — observes `NSWorkspace`
//!   screensaver and sleep notifications via `IOKit`.
//!
//! Both implement the same trait; consumers add them with
//! `attach_event_source` exactly like the MVP sources.
//!
//! ## Trait contract
//!
//! [`OsLockEventSource::run`] takes `self: Box<Self>` — the controller
//! boxes the source before spawning its thread, then calls `run`
//! which consumes the box. There are no restart semantics; if a
//! source's run loop exits (clean or error), the source is gone.
//! Design §3.9 records the rationale.
//!
//! ## Clean shutdown (Phase 5 T5.0)
//!
//! Before consuming the source via `run`, the controller calls
//! [`OsLockEventSource::shutdown_handle`] to obtain a
//! [`ShutdownHandle`]. The controller stores the handle alongside the
//! source's `JoinHandle` and, on `Drop`, invokes the handle to signal
//! the source's run loop to exit and then joins the thread. Sources
//! that block on a kernel-side primitive (signal-hook self-pipe,
//! `DBus` connection, `CFRunLoop`) wake on the signal and return
//! from `run` with `Ok(())`.
//!
//! Implementations choose how to wire the signal: typically by holding
//! a clone of an upstream "close" handle (`signal_hook::iterator::Handle`,
//! `zbus::Connection`, `CFRunLoopRef`) and returning a closure that
//! invokes it. See [`NoopSource::shutdown_handle`] and
//! [`SigstopSource::shutdown_handle`] for two reference patterns.
//!
//! Risk #12 in the feature's `follow-ups/open-items.md` (MVP's "OS
//! reaps source threads at process exit") is resolved by this
//! contract.
