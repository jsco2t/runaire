//! Deterministic `Clock` implementation for integration tests.
//!
//! [`FakeClock`] wraps an `Arc<Mutex<Instant>>` so a single instance
//! can be cloned across threads (rarely needed in MVP — the
//! controller is `Send + !Sync` and runs on one thread — but the
//! invariant lets Phase 3's clipboard tests share it freely if they
//! ever need to). The clock starts at a caller-supplied `Instant`
//! and advances only when [`Self::advance`] is called.
